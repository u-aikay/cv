  <p>(On this day 09th of April, 2020) I am the current Marketing and public
    relations officer at blueridge-MFB.
    I graduated as a chemical Engineer from one of the most prestigous university
    in Nigeria(Ahmadu Bello University). Job hunting moved me to different state
    in search of the perfect job suitable to my certificate. It was not an easy
    run especially the moment I was about reloacating to Lagos which had to push
    me to tour the road of Lagos; Abuja; and Abia state too often in less than
    3days. My journey has not been the best experience but keeping my head high
    and keep planning has always been my routine, sometimes in my journey I
    question God and his Godly things/work a lot which he still brings me back to
    him as a father to a lost son and I know it's all on his grace.
